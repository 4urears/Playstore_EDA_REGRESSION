# Google Play Store App Ratings Prediction 📱🌟

## Overview

An insightful analysis of app data from the Google Play Store to predict ratings based on features and user sentiments.

### 📁 Files

- **`googleplaystore.csv`**: Dataset containing app details from Google Play Store.
- **`googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv`**: Dataset with user reviews and sentiments for each app.

## Objective 🚀

The project dives into extensive exploratory analysis and constructs a Linear Regression model to predict app ratings using data from Google Play Store datasets.
